        <h2>DataCrafters: Automotive Cybersecurity Dashboard</h2>
        <p>
            DataCrafters presents an advanced, user-friendly solution for analyzing and visualizing automotive cybersecurity datasets. This project is designed to help engineers and researchers identify, monitor, and mitigate vulnerabilities in vehicle communication systems, particularly those using Controller Area Network (CAN) protocols. Leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques, DataCrafters transforms raw automotive data into actionable insights.
        </p>
        <p>
            The system provides a comprehensive dashboard featuring dynamic visualizations, real-time analysis, and intuitive interactions. The platform integrates <strong>anomaly detection algorithms</strong>, such as Isolation Forest and DBSCAN clustering, to identify potential attacks like Denial of Service (DoS), Fuzzy, and spoofing attacks. By incorporating time-series and correlation analysis, it highlights trends and relationships between CAN message fields, making it easier to pinpoint vulnerabilities.
        </p>
        <h2>Key Features:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Visual Analytics:</strong> Interactive charts and graphs, such as attack distributions, anomaly clustering, and time-series trends.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Data Integration:</strong> Seamlessly processes incoming automotive data through API connections for live insights.</li>
            <li><strong>Customizable Thresholds:</strong> Users can fine-tune detection thresholds to adapt to specific datasets and reduce false positives.</li>
            <li><strong>Alerts and Reporting:</strong> Generates alerts for anomalies and enables users to download raw or processed data for further study.</li>
            <li><strong>Regional Insights:</strong> Geospatial visualizations provide a location-based perspective on attack patterns.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Built with a robust stack of technologies, including Python, Streamlit, MySQL, and machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow, DataCrafters ensures high performance and flexibility. Its modular architecture makes it easy to adapt and extend for future needs, such as integrating additional datasets or deploying in real-world environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you're a researcher, security professional, or automotive manufacturer, DataCrafters empowers you to safeguard vehicles against evolving cybersecurity threats in a connected and autonomous world.
